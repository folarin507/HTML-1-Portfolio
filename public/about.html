<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Kayode Akinfolarin, an aspiring web developer. i started on this Tech journey in 2021 at cholatrek training insitute. it felt very strange at the time because computer language was a language i wasn't familiar with at the time. but i put in a lot of work and dedication because, i have always beleievd that i will make it in the tech industry and i kept pushing bvecause i knew there was no going back for me. but i thank God because, i'm way better than that.
  Today, to the Glory of God i'm aiming to become the best i can ever become in this field. Cheers!!
